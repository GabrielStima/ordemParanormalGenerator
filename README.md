<h1 align="left">Hey ðŸ‘‹ What's up?</h1>

###

<p align="left">This project is based on an RPG system called 'Ordem Paranormal' and aims to randomly generate character sheets and quests in order to help the DM.</p>
<p align="left">I made this project unpretentiously just to help me come up with ideas for missions and create NPCs for my campaigns, but I didn't find anything similar on the internet for this system so I thought it would be interesting to put it together in a minimally presentable way and share it on the GitHub Pages.</p>

<h2 align="left">About the project</h2>

###

<p align="left">At first I created a node API just for myself, but when I changed my mind I saw some options for free hosting on the internet and the best one for the moment would be GitHub Pages.</p>

<p align="left">So I created something extremely simple with HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
